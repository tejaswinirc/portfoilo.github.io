            <p><B>Project 1: CARDIAC HEALTH ASSESSMENT FOR VEHICLE DRIVERS: ECG MONITORING ANDHEART DISEASE DIAGNOSIS USING IOT AND 
                MACHINE LEARNING</B></p>
            <p> My Project Cardiac Health Assessment System for Vehicle Drivers leverages the integration of Machine Learning
                (ML) and the Internet of Things (IoT) to ensure continuous monitoring and analysis of drivers' cardiovascular well-being.
                Employing smart wearables equipped with ECG sensors, the system captures real-time heart health data during driving and
                non-driving periods. Through IoT connectivity, this information is seamlessly transmitted to a centralized platform. 
                Advanced ML algorithms analyze the ECG patterns, enabling the early detection of irregularities and potential risks. In 
                case of abnormalities, the system issues immediate alerts, facilitating prompt intervention and, if necessary, remote medical
                consultations. The system's user-friendly interface provides drivers with access to their health data and personalized 
                recommendations, fostering proactive health management. This innovative approach not only enhances driver safety by 
                identifying potential cardiac issues but also contributes to a data- driven understanding of the relationship between
                cardiovascular health and driving conditions.

            <p><B>Project 2:RESTAURANT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM USING WEB DEVELOPMENT </B></p>
            <p>A restaurant management system (RMS) is a type of point-of-sale (POS) software specifically designed for restaurants, bars, food trucks and others in the food service industry. Unlike a POS system, and RMS encompasses all back-end needs, such as inventory to staff management.
                This restaurant management system can be used by employees in a restaurant to handle the clients, their orders and can help them easily find free tables. 
                In order to maximize a restaurant’s profitability, one has to always examine and understand a restaurant’s operational costs and how these relate to a restaurant’s productivity and efficiency in delivering quality service to its customers. Management takes a very important role in controlling and manipulating the balance of costs and profitability.
